Learning Go

Following the [Go by example](https://gobyexample.com/) tutorials.

## Running Instructions

Run the program:
```shell
go run hello-world.go
```

Package it into a binary:
```shell
go build hello-world.go
```

Execute the binary:
```shell
./hello-world
```

## Notes

- Filenames use dashes `hello-world.go`
- You can omit the return type if the function doesn't return anything
- `...someVar` means 0 or more values
- Boolean logic is similar to Scala, `&&`/`||`/`!`
